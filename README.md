# Full Stack Dev I
This branch contains the files for the Full Stack application that was built utilizing the MVC pattern and MEAN stack for the CS 465 Full Stack Dev I course. Included is the Software Design Document which details the goal and purpose of the application, as well as steps taken to create it. For context, the project was defined as follows "Travlr Getaways requires a travel booking site so their customers can book travel packages. The site must allow users to create an account, search for packages via multiple filters, book vacation packages, and view itineraries prior to trips. Additionally Travlr Getaways would like an admin-only site where administrators are able to maintain the site and its functionality."
