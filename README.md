<B>How do I approach designing software?</B>

Throughout this course, the incremental method by which I approach software design was staunchly reinforced and practiced. As this was one of the most complex programs done during my time programming, and I had no previous experience with OpenGL, it was essential for me to work incrementally, and approach each week as a sprint, to organize and efficiently handle the workload. The work during this course has broadened my ability as a developer tremendously. Previous to this course, I had no knowledge on the topic of rendering models and creating a 3D space to traverse. The knowledge and skills gained during this course have served to round me out as a developer and allowed me to establish a foundation in an area of development previously unexplored to me. This will ultimately serve to reinforce my ability as a developer, and make me more capable and able to perform in a variety of development situations and developmental goals. 

<B>How do I approach developing programs?</B>

One new development strategy I heavily relied on was iterative development. I often employ incremental development, but had not had a program large enough, or that had to evolve enough to require much iterative development. As each week and milestone for the project built upon the previous, I recreated the same sections of code many times to apply the necessary requirements. This iterative development made the tackling of a larger program much more manageable. Similar to how the first sentence in a massive essay is always the hardest, attempting to meet the full expectations of the project from the get-go would have been unrealistic to where my skills were at the beginning of the course. By continuously building upon the program, and reinforcing the skills we had learned the previous week, I never encountered the feeling of not knowing where to begin. The coding practices adopted during this project will be invaluable for me going forward, as the work will only increase in complexity. The necessity for not only incremental, but iterative development is becoming increasingly necessary. Going forward I will continue to hone my strategy in iterative development, and better learn to break down complex requirements into adequate sprints and tackle the project piecemeal. 

<B>How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?</B>

As previously touched upon, I had lacked any knowledge or practice in computational graphics and visualization, these skills have opened an entire sector of development previously unexplored. This will not only make me a more well rounded developer, but provide me additional opportunity and avenue for advancement in both my educational career and professional career. The ability to work in a position related to computational graphics and visualization opens an entire sector of development in a variety of fields. Additionally, I had always wanted to develop a small game as a personal pet project, but had lacked the necessary foundation to do so. Now that this course has reached its conclusion, I feel confident in my foundational ability to be able to tackle such an endeavor. Whereas before, I was wholly ignorant of computational graphics and visualization, I now have the necessary foundation to ask appropriate questions and continue my education into the subject in my personal life. In essence, I now know what questions to ask, and how to ask them to make the development of a small game feasible for me. Ultimately, this course has broadened my abilities as a developer tremendously, and has served to provide me with important foundational knowledge in graphical computation and visualization.
