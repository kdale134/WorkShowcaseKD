# Current/Emerging Trends in CS

<b>Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?</b>
	For the final project, we assumed the role of an AI developer for a gaming company. The company was in the process of developing a treasure hunt game where the player needs to find the treasure before the pirate (agent). As the company's AI developer, I was tasked with solving the pathfinding problem for the agent by implementing deep Q-learning within the training of the neural network. 
	We were provided with a template that had already included the necessary import functions, maze array, multiple helper functions, an actions directory and epsilon definition, the definition of the neural network, as well as the two separate files responsible for functionality, GameExperience.py and TrasureMaze.py. Our instruction was to implement deep Q-learning in the training, as well as tweak certain metaparameters to enable the agent to find the best possible navigation sequence that results in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing reward. Without the ability to reinforce upon prior learning, the agent would be randomly selecting a different path each time, with no real direction. By striking a balance between exploration and exploitation, we can ensure our agent’s experiment to find new solutions, while relying upon prior experience to inform current attempts. 

<b>Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:</b>
	One of the things I have come to love about computer science, and specifically software engineering, is the extreme breadth of possibilities within the field. In just the last two semesters, I have learned about both AI/Intelligent systems, as well as embedded systems and technology. While previously aware of both of these industries, I did not expect the chance to learn about, and gain first-hand experience operating on these systems so soon. This varied exposure and experience has further complicated the concept of computer science and software engineering, as the potential for what they can do is so broad. In essence, computer scientists/software engineers apply engineering principles and programming knowledge to build, maintain, or refactor software solutions for end-users. Anyone in the modern world can immediately see the relevance of this work, and why it matters. In an increasingly complicated and data-filled world, the necessity for responsible and ethical development has never been more dire. Negligence or malice on the part of developers can have disastrously negative effects, while compassion and equality in development can promote great unity. Ultimately, the power of software developers and the systems they create has never before had the same potential to either greatly benefit or harm our interests. Therefore, it is imperative to take the role of development seriously, and ensure ethical practice. 
	This course has fundamentally changed the nature by which I approach development and problems in computer science. No class has provided so stark of examples to demonstrate the effect of bias within computers and ourselves, and how this can be reflected and mimicked within the systems we create. Although we explored many aspects of AI and intelligent systems during this course, both mechanically and philosophically, my favorite portion revolved around exploring the examples of bias within these systems and how it came to be. This class stressed important principles such as ethics by design, and the necessity for development to meet a community need, rather than for the sake of possibility. There is no doubt that intelligent systems are extremely powerful tools that can provide us with great benefits to efficiency, however, if not utilized carefully, they possess the same potential to further propagate injustices that have no need for further avenues of expression. In my career as a developer, going forward, I will be much more cognisant to proactively exercise ethics by design, and ensure my development goals serve a purpose beyond just possibility.
As touched upon, there are many ethical responsibilities that developers must bear in the modern world. These responsibilities extend to the user, the company/institution, and oneself. In regard to the end-user, developers have a moral (and often legal) obligation to practice ethics by design, and adopt certain ethical principles that will help mitigate the propagation of injustice or misuse. This can come in the form of adequate training data, ample defense in depth (DiD) systems, as well as adhering to certain standards of ethics such as responsible research and innovation (RRI) or the sentiment behind the rules found in the GDPR. This would include practices like sanitizing data after usage, or only collecting data that has a purpose. By engaging in ethical practices, developers can ensure their obligation to the end-user can be continuously met and fulfilled.
	In addition to the end-user, developers (obviously) have an ethical responsibility to the company/institution that employs them. This includes a great deal of responsibilities, both related to work and social behavior. Regarding work specifically, developers must ensure that they abide by their organization’s standard of security and ethics. Developers also owe their organization the loyalty and respect to work to their best ability. It is human nature to, at least occasionally, want to cut corners. This must be avoided at all costs, as it would be doing a disservice to the end-user, developer, and organization that employs them. With staunch dedication to upholding personal and organizational best practices as well as ensuring maximum effort, developers can guarantee to satisfy their obligation and responsibilities toward their institution/organization.
Finally, the developer has an ethical responsibility toward themselves. Aligned with some of the topics discussed previously, submitting or presenting on vulnerable, faulty, or rushed work is unacceptable. Software development is difficult, nobody will deny that, however, with proper time management, dedication to improvement, and refusal to stop, developers can ensure they meet the ethical responsibility they have toward themselves. The onus to ensure systems like AI are used to benefit rather than harm falls upon developers, as we are the ones with the skills to execute these systems. It is our responsibility to ensure we each, as individuals, continue to uphold the tenets behind ethical design despite our surroundings, because it is right.
