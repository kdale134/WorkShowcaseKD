# CS-305-Software-Security-22EW3

<b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b>
 - Artemis Financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. This includes savings, retirement, insurance, and investment accounts. Their goal is to modernize their operations, and make the most of current effective software security. They will accomplish this by modernizing their operation and utilize the RESTful web API they employ to the fullest extent, and make it as secure as possible from external threats.
  
<b>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b>
- I believe I did a good job of identifying the needs of the client, and meeting those needs with the proper recommendation and implementation of software. Additionally, I spent a large amount of time going through each vulnerability and establishing a fix, to ensure the most secure program possible for Artemis Financial. When developing or refactoring code, it is essential to utilize industry standard best practices and develop secure code. This will cut down on development time, by avoiding the inclusion of additional errors when refactoring code. Additionally, by not introducing new vulnerabilities with refactoring, a developer can steadily reduce the total number of vulnerabilities present in code until none exist. Utilizing best practices also provides a standard form to code, that will allow any developer on a company's team to pick up where another left off, further increasing efficiency and saving time. Best practices are not only beneficial to the program itself, but by building a reputation for developing solid, well secured products, a company can establish a relationship of trust and reliance with their users, boosting the health of the company on many levels. Industry standard best practices exist for a reason, and adhering to them will allow a company to consistently produce efficient and secure programs that their customers can rely on.

<b>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b>
- The most informative part of the vulnerability assessment for me was the suppression of false-positives. This forced me to develop a greater understanding of the vulnerability report itself, as well as each individual vulnerability present. This also highlighted to me, personally, that much of my software was out of date and needed to be updated ASAP. This ultimately led to me having a much greater understanding of the development process, as well as many of the various software associated with implementing a restful API. 
  
<b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b>
- My process for adding layers of security has taken an incremental approach during this course. For our second project this started with laying down the necessary function first, then adding each layer of required security afterward. This included the SHA-256 checksum as well as establishing https connection with the Spring servlet. In the future, for programs of a smaller scope, I would utilize an OWASP Vulnerability Assessment Report as well as a manual review of the code. This will highlight pressing vulnerabilities through the report, as well as hopefully illuminate any logical errors present in the code with the manual review. For larger programs I would utilize the same vulnerability report and may utilize a manual review for important sections of the code, depending on functionality. As manual reviews become more costly the larger a program is, I would use this technique sparingly.
  
<b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b>
- Similar to my response above, I utilized the OWASP dependency report, run before and after refactoring, to ensure I had not introduced any additional vulnerabilities to code I changed. This report can also be used upon completion of refactoring to address and remaining vulnerabilities present before implementation. 

<b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b>
- Throughout the course, we were introduced to a variety of new software that will be beneficial in my career as a developer going forward. In addition to the OWASP dependency report, I am now decently familiar with the operation and implementation of a spring servlet and restful API. Prior to this course, I had been made familiar with best coding practices, but had not understood the magnitude of their import. Going forward, I will be actively conscious of developing code that is as secure as possible, checking my work with the dependency report, and keeping myself up-to-date on new vulnerabilities or new fixes as well as the world of cyber security as a whole.

<b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b>
- This assignment demonstrates my ability to produce and interpret a vulnerability report. This is an extremely important skill for producing the most secure code possible, as well as a developmental tool to continuously hone and improve my process as a developer. I also plan to include the work from the module 2 project, which demonstrates my ability to add layers of security to a spring servlet, as well as employ best practices to produce secure code.
