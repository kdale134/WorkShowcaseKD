<b>How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?</b>

-I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure by first, following best practices for development. This includes best security practices as DevSecOps is growing in popularity and is important to understand and utilize. Outside of best practices, it is important for me to employ a variety of tools, to ensure my program is as efficient and defect free as possible, before escalating in development. This includes static reviews, vulnerability assessments, and the various phases of testing to ensure continued relevance and function. Utilizing the techniques learned and honed in this course, I have built a solid foundation for efficiently ensuring the relevant function of an application.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

-As a developer or tester, understanding the purpose, goal, and requirements are all important pieces of the development of a product. This familiarity allows one to better plan their work, prioritize and guide requirements, and develop efficiently with care. When approaching the development of each of the three features of the project, I made sure to constantly reference the requirements. This allowed me to better ensure that the client requirements were being properly addressed in the functionality being implemented, and guide the JUnit tests created to ensure implemented functionality as well as adequate testing coverage and relevancy.

<b>How do I approach designing software?</b>

-While working on this project, I adopted a confident, yet wary attitude. This was due to the fact that the large majority of my unit code had done exemplary and required very little correction before integration into a whole. Although I was confident that the project would not require much debugging, I still regularly employed caution. This took the form of duplicating the project immediately upon integration, to provide a fallback should I catastrophically ruin something. Additionally, I applied the same iterative and methodical pattern to my development, as I had done throughout the milestones. This better allowed me to address each requirement individually and ensure I had properly met the client requirements. An iterative development provides the added benefit of seeing my work with ‘fresh eyes’ multiple times, rather than once or twice when the project is tackled in large chunks. I have found this extremely beneficial for debugging and software testing.
