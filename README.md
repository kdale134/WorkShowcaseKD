# CS350-Emerging-Systems-Architecture-Tech

<b>Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.</b>
For our final project in this course, we were tasked with creating a Task Scheduler and incorporating the necessary functionality to simulate a remote-controller heater system on our TI boards. This functionality included GPIO to control the board LED or hardware, timer functionality to institute interrupts and proper operation, I2C functionality to utilize the boards thermostat, and UART to facilitate and simulate communication between the heater and the server used to control it. This project was completed in Code Composer Studio (CCS). 

<b>What did you do particularly well?</b>
Throughout this course, I found that I was particularly effective at designing state machines and task schedulers. Personally, by far the easiest portion of this course was creating the logic behind the various state machines and task schedulers required. I found this portion of the course to be similar to prior experience I had, and aligned with my strengths as a developer.  

<b>Where could you improve?</b>
One area I could improve, particularly in relation to this course, is further familiarizing myself with the available languages, IDE, and hardware that are popular currently. My experience up to this point had primarily focused on purely software-related projects and work. When confronted with this course and embedded systems, I was initially a ‘fish out of water’. The task of considering the physical constraints and aspects of a system was foreign to my thought process as a developer, further illustrating to me that there is always more to learn, and I will continuously hone my skills as a developer. 

<b>What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?</b>
As mentioned in the previous response, prior to this course I was completely new to embedded systems and development. I have gained a foundational knowledge base and experience in a field of development I was wholly ignorant of prior. Specifically, I have gained a foundational knowledge of embedded system principles, embedded development, CCS, and the TI 3220S SmartLink board. 

<b>What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?</b>
In addition to the specific knowledge gained in the course, the cognisance of physical constraints and importance of hardware efficiency instilled by delving into embedded systems will benefit me no matter the type of development I am currently engaged in. Prior to this course, I was ignorant to many of the physical constraints placed upon systems as well as the importance of efficiency. Although efficiency is important in standard software development, this importance is critical for embedded systems. Being cognisant of the best principles and practices of embedded systems will benefit me as a developer both in specific skill and general knowledge. 

<b>How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?</b>
My strategies employed for ensuring maintainability, readability, and adaptability were simple. I made sure to employ best practices while developing the system, adhered strictly to client requirements (while improving, where able), and provided adequate documentation and notation in the project itself. It was important for me to ensure that if another developer were to continue development on this system, they could quickly and easily understand the structure and purpose of the system, just from the code. By following best practices, I was able to ensure that the code can be easily adjusted or refactored by me, or any other developer working on the system.
